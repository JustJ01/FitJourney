## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   A Google Firebase account
-   A Cloudinary account
-   A Razorpay account

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    -   Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    -   Add a "Web" app to your project.
    -   Copy the Firebase config object and paste it into `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
    -   Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password provider).
    -   Enable **Firestore** in Test Mode for now (you should add security rules for production).
    -   Enable **Storage**.

4.  **Set up Cloudinary & Razorpay:**
    -   Get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret from your Cloudinary dashboard.
    -   Get your Key ID and Key Secret from your Razorpay dashboard (Test mode is recommended for development).

5.  **Environment Variables:**
    -   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
    -   Add your Firebase, Cloudinary, and Razorpay credentials. You will also need to enable Google AI services in the Google Cloud console for your Firebase project.

    ```plaintext
    # Cloudinary Credentials
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

    # Razorpay Credentials
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
    RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret

    # Google AI (Genkit) Credentials - obtained from Google Cloud
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:9002`.

### Firestore Indexes

This project uses complex queries that require composite indexes in Firestore. The application will log errors to the console with a direct link to create any missing indexes when a query fails. Be sure to create these indexes in your Firebase project for features like "Highest Rated Plans" and "Featured Reviews" to work correctly.
